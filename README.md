# Azure AD B2C extension

The Azure AD B2C extension for VS Code lets you quickly navigate through Azure AD B2C [custom policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-overview-custom). Create new elements, such as: technical profiles and claim definition. For more information, see [Get started with custom policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-get-started-custom).

### Application Insights
Collect logs from Azure AD B2C and diagnose problems with your Azure AD B2C vscode extension. Read more [here](https://github.com/yoelhor/aad-b2c-vs-code-extension/blob/master/src/help/app-insights.md). The logs are organized by the **policy name**, **correlation Id** (the application insights presents the first digit of the correlation Id), and the **log timestamp**. This allows you to find the relevant log based on the local timestamp and see the user journey as executed by Azure AD B2C.

### App Settings
Allows you to manage the values of your Azure AD B2C environments. When you execute the **B2C Policy build** command, the VS code extension finds and replaces the values of your settings with the ones configure in the policy file, and creates a directory that contains all of your policy files (after the replacement). In the following example, the extension replaces the keys with the value configure in the `appsettings.json` file: 
- {Settings:Tenant}
- {Settings:IdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId}
- {Settings:ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId}
- {Settings:FacebookAppId}

The configuration `appsettings.json` file contains the keys with their values for each environment. The **Name** key contains the environment name, which VS code extension uses to create such a folder under the environments folder - use your operation system legal characters only. The **Production** key (boolean) is preserved for future use, indicating whether the environment is a production one. In the policy file, use the format of **Settings:** and the key name, for example `{Settings:Key}`.

On the first time you run the **B2C Policy build** command, the VS code extension lets you create the  `appsettings.json` file, with default set of environments, keys, and values:

```JSON
{
  "Environments": [
  {
    "Name": "Test",
    "Production": false,
    "Tenant": "your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com",
    "IdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your AD app Id",
    "ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your AD Proxy app Id",
    "FacebookAppId": "0"
  },
  {
    "Name": "QA",
    "Production": false,
    "Tenant": "your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com",
    "IdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your AD app Id",
    "ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your AD Proxy app Id",
    "FacebookAppId": "0"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Production",
    "Production": true,
    "Tenant": "your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com",
    "IdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your AD app Id",
    "ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your AD Proxy app Id",
    "FacebookAppId": "0"
  }]
}
```
You can add, or remove environments, keys, and values, to accommodate your needs. For example, you can add new settings, such as the URL of a REST API end point, Google+ app Id, URL of content definitions, and so on. You can also add new environment, such as pre-prod. Make sure you provide the same set of key (with the relevant values) for each environment. In the following example, we add the **Pre-Production** environment and new set of key-values.

```JSON
{
  "Environments": [
  {
    "Name": "Test",
    ...
  },
  {
    "Name": "QA",
    ...
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pre-Production",
  },
  {
    "Name": "Production",
    "Production": true,
    "Tenant": "your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com",
    "IdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your AD app Id",
    "ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your AD Proxy app Id",
    "FacebookAppId": "0",
    "MicrosoftAppId": "0",
    "GoogleAppId": "0",
    "RESTApiServer",
    "HTMLPagesServer"
  }]
}
```
After the command is completed, you will find the exported policies under the **Environment** folder. Before you upload the policy to your Azure AD B2C tenant, check the values of the exported policy files.
